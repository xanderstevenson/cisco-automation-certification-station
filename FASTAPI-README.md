# FastAPI Implementation for Cisco Automation Certification Station

This document describes the FastAPI implementation option for the Cisco Automation Certification Station. This implementation provides the same functionality and appearance as the original Flask + Streamlit implementation, but uses FastAPI instead of Flask for the server component.

## Why FastAPI?

FastAPI offers several advantages over Flask:

- **Performance**: FastAPI is built on Starlette and is one of the fastest Python web frameworks available
- **Modern Python**: Built for Python 3.6+ with full type hints support
- **Automatic API documentation**: Swagger UI and ReDoc built-in
- **Dependency injection**: More structured request handling
- **WebSocket support**: Native support for WebSockets
- **Async/await**: First-class support for async code

## Implementation Details

The FastAPI implementation follows the same architecture as the Flask implementation:

1. FastAPI server (`fastapi_server.py`) serves the initial loading page
2. FastAPI starts Streamlit in the background
3. When Streamlit is ready, FastAPI redirects to it
4. All functionality and appearance remain identical to the original implementation

## How to Run

### Local Development

To run the FastAPI implementation locally:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-lite.txt

# Run FastAPI server
python fastapi_server.py
```

Or using uvicorn directly:

```bash
uvicorn fastapi_server:app --reload --port 8080
```

### Docker Deployment

To build and run the FastAPI implementation using Docker:

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t cisco-automation-fastapi -f Dockerfile.fastapi .

# Run Docker container
docker run -p 8080:8080 cisco-automation-fastapi
```

### Google Cloud Run Deployment

To deploy the FastAPI implementation to Google Cloud Run:

```bash
# Build and deploy
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/cisco-automation-fastapi --timeout=30m
gcloud run deploy cisco-automation-fastapi --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/cisco-automation-fastapi --platform managed --allow-unauthenticated
```

## API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates API documentation. When running locally, you can access:

- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8080/redoc

## Differences from Flask Implementation

The FastAPI implementation is functionally identical to the Flask implementation, with the following differences:

1. Uses FastAPI instead of Flask for the server component
2. Includes automatic API documentation
3. Improved error handling and logging
4. Better performance for high-traffic scenarios

## File Structure

- `fastapi_server.py`: Main FastAPI server implementation
- `Dockerfile.fastapi`: Docker configuration for FastAPI deployment
- `requirements-lite.txt`: Updated with FastAPI dependencies

All other files remain the same as the original implementation.
